AI.tv - Real-time SVG-based Video Generation with ML and Neural Nets

AI.tv Logo

Description:
AI.tv is an innovative platform that leverages SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) markup language to enable real-time video generation powered by Machine Learning (ML) and Neural Networks. Unlike traditional pixel raster-based videos, AI.tv produces vector-based videos, offering greater scalability and quality.
